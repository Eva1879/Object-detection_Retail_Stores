# Object-detection_Retail_Stores
This project was undertaken to minimize operational inneficiances in retail stores, by the stockers whilst re-stocking or re-arranging, to improve object detection at complex planograms, restocking processes, and setting groundwork for improvements, by introducing largely sized objects, experimenting YOLO models and improved dataset and more inclined camera views.
